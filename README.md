# Scripts
-script_distribute_xFC_erg.m :creates every possible combination of measure, then it calls multi_range_qsub in order to create the .m files and the jobs that will be launched with the cluster.

-script_distribute_xFC_missing_subjects.m : creates every possible combination of measure, then it calls multi_range_qsub in order to create the .m files and the jobs that will be launched with the cluster but just the missing subjects.

-script_calculate_ve_erg.m : load every xFC.mat generated by the two last scripts and calculate the variance explained for them. It also plots the results.

-script_analyze_ve_erg.m : print different plots from the VE matrix calculated in script_calculate_ve_erg.,

-script_spearman_*: calculate the Spearman Correlation across the different FC measures, parcellations and preprocessing steps. It also plots the violin plots for these correlations. 

The remaining scripts are auxiliary for the execution of the previous scripts.
